name: Feature request
about: Suggest either a new feature or an improvement to existing feature
---

<!-- Please give a detailed description of the desired improvement here
Be sure to include at least:
- How you think the new feature/improvement would be helpful, or what problem you think it would solve
- If there are similar features already, why the new feature/enhancement would be an improvement over those

If you'd like a new lyric source to be added, you must provide at least one example per source of a track whose lyrics are available on the new source but are not available on any existing sources. Each example must include an artist & track name, and must include an album name if it is part of an album. Album versions of tracks are preferred. If your example only applies to for a particular non-album version of a track (e.g a live or acoustic version), it may be disregarded.
